# Kubernetes Workflow

### 1. Declaration of Desired State:

- Define the desired state using YAML files.

### 2. Master Node Takes Charge:

- The master node receives the application blueprint and decides how to distribute the work among worker nodes.
- **Components involved:** `API Server`, `etcd`, `Controller Manager`, and `Scheduler`.

- During the **"Master Node Takes Charge"** step, these components collaborate:

  - The `API Server` receives the desired state from users and forwards it to the `etcd` for storage.
  - The `Controller Manager` continuously monitors the cluster state through the `API Server` and ensures that the current state aligns with the desired state by making adjustments as needed.
  - The `Scheduler` is activated when new **Pods** need to be created. It evaluates the available resources on nodes and assigns **Pods** to appropriate **nodes** based on the declared requirements.

### 3. Deployment:

- Master node instructs worker nodes to deploy containers based on the declared state.
- **Components involved:** `Kubelet`, `Container Runtime`, `Nodes`.
- During the **"Deployment"** step, the interaction and roles of these components are as follows:

  - The API Server communicates the desired state, including the **Pod** specifications, to the `Kubelet` on each **node**.
  - The `Kubelet`, on receiving the **Pod** specifications, ensures that the **containers** within the **Pod** are running and healthy. It communicates with the `Container Runtime` to pull images and manage the container lifecycle.
  - The `Container Runtime` executes the containers, pulling images as needed, and manages their lifecycle on the **node**.

### 4. Self-Healing:

- Kubernetes monitors containers and nodes; if any misbehave or fail, it automatically replaces or reschedules them.
- **Components involved:** `Kubelet`, `Controller Manager`.
- During the **"Self-Healing"** step, these components collaborate:

  - The `Kubelet` continuously monitors the health of containers within **Pods** on its **node**. If a **container** becomes unhealthy or fails, the `Kubelet` reports this to the `control plane`.
  - The `Controller Manager`, specifically the **Replication Controller** or **ReplicaSet Controller**, detects the difference between the desired number of replicas and the actual number of running Pods. It then initiates actions to bring the cluster back to the desired state, such as creating new Pods or replacing failed ones.

### 5. Scaling:

- Kubernetes can scale up by adding more containers if there's increased demand.
- **Components involved:** `API Server`, `Controller Manager`.
- During the **"Scaling"** step, the components collaborate as follows:

  - The `API Server` receives scaling requests from users or automation tools, specifying the desired number of replicas or resources.
  - The `Controller Manager`, specifically the **ReplicaSet Controller**, interprets the scaling request and adjusts the desired number of replicas to match the specified scaling requirements.
  - The adjusted desired state is communicated to the `Kubelet` on each **node**, which then takes action to implement the scaling decisions by creating or terminating **Pods**.
  - The `Container Runtime` is responsible for creating and managing the additional **containers** needed to meet the scaling requirements.

### 6. Load Balancing:

- Distributes incoming traffic among containers to prevent overload on any single container.
- **Components involved:** `Kube-proxy`.
- During the **"Load Balancing"** step, the components collaborate as follows:

  - `Kube-proxy` maintains network rules on **nodes**, specifically dealing with the routing of traffic to different **Pods**. It ensures that incoming requests are distributed among the available **Pods** to prevent overloading a single Pod.

  - `Services` play a crucial role in **load balancing** by providing a stable endpoint for a set of **Pods**. They abstract away the complexity of individual Pod IPs and distribute traffic evenly among the **Pods** associated with the service.

### 7. Service Discovery:

- Enables containers to easily find and communicate with each other.
- **Components involved:** `Kubelet`.
- During the **"Service Discovery"** step, the components collaborate as follows:

  - `Kubelet` on each **node** communicates with the control plane components to ensure that containers within Pods can discover and communicate with each other. It actively participates in maintaining the networking setup and DNS resolution.

  - `Services` provide a layer of abstraction and a stable endpoint for a set of Pods. They abstract away the individual Pod IPs, enabling seamless service discovery. Containers within Pods can communicate with other services using the stable DNS names or IP addresses provided by the Services.

### 8. Updates and Rollbacks:

- Handles rolling updates, gradually replacing old containers with new ones.
- **Components involved:** `API Server`, `Controller Manager`.
- During the **"Updates and Rollbacks"** step, the components collaborate as follows:

  - `API Server` receives instructions for updates or rollbacks, defining the changes in the desired state.

  - `Controller Manager` ensures the controlled replacement of existing resources with new ones during updates. In the case of rollbacks, it reverts to the previous state.

  - `Kubelet` on each node implements the changes instructed by the **control plane**. It ensures that new containers are started, and old ones are gracefully terminated.

  - `Container Runtime` executes the changes in container versions. It pulls new container images and manages the lifecycle of the containers, facilitating a smooth transition during updates and rollbacks.
