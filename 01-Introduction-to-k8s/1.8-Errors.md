# Errors

### 1. **Pod Scheduling Issues**

- **Insufficient Resources:**

  ```sh
  0/3 nodes are available: insufficient CPU.
  ```

  **Troubleshooting:**

  - Check resource requests and limits in your Pod specification.
  - Ensure your cluster has sufficient resources.
  - Use `kubectl describe nodes` to see the available resources on each node.

- **Node Affinity/Anti-affinity:**
  ```sh
  No nodes are available that match all of the following predicates: PodFitsHostPorts, PodFitsResources.
  ```
  **Troubleshooting:**
  - Review your Pod's affinity and anti-affinity rules.
  - Check node labels and ensure they match your Pod's requirements.

### 2. **Container Image Issues**

- **Image Pull Errors:**

  ```sh
  Failed to pull image "myapp:latest": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: manifest for myapp:latest not found
  ```

  **Troubleshooting:**

  - Verify the image name and tag.
  - Ensure the image is available in the specified container registry.
  - Check for network issues or authentication problems with the registry.

- **Image Pull Backoff:**
  ```sh
  Back-off pulling image "myapp:latest"
  ```
  **Troubleshooting:**
  - Investigate why the image pull is failing using `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`.
  - Ensure correct image tags and availability.

### 3. **Pod Startup Issues**

- **CrashLoopBackOff:**

  ```sh
  CrashLoopBackOff
  ```

  **Troubleshooting:**

  - Check container logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name>`.
  - Identify and fix the issue causing the container to crash.

- **RunContainerError:**
  ```sh
  RunContainerError: failed to start container "myapp": Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed
  ```
  **Troubleshooting:**
  - Check container logs and events.
  - Verify the container runtime configuration.

### 4. **Network Issues**

- **Service Unreachable:**

  ```sh
  Unable to connect to the service "my-service"
  ```

  **Troubleshooting:**

  - Verify the Service configuration.
  - Check if the Service has the correct selector and endpoints.
  - Use `kubectl get endpoints <service-name>` to see if endpoints are correctly configured.

- **DNS Issues:**
  ```sh
  Unable to resolve "my-service"
  ```
  **Troubleshooting:**
  - Check CoreDNS logs using `kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns`.
  - Ensure DNS policies and configurations are correct.

### 5. **Persistent Storage Issues**

- **PVC Pending:**

  ```sh
  PersistentVolumeClaim is in state Pending
  ```

  **Troubleshooting:**

  - Ensure there are available PersistentVolumes that match the claim's specifications.
  - Check StorageClass configurations.

- **Volume Mount Errors:**
  ```sh
  Unable to mount volumes for pod "my-pod": timeout expired waiting for volumes to attach/mount
  ```
  **Troubleshooting:**
  - Check the underlying storage provider and its integration with Kubernetes.
  - Verify volume configurations and access permissions.

### 6. **Configuration Issues**

- **Invalid Resource Definitions:**

  ```sh
  error: error validating "deployment.yaml": error validating data: [ValidationError(Deployment.spec): unknown field "invalidField" in io.k8s.api.apps.v1.DeploymentSpec]
  ```

  **Troubleshooting:**

  - Validate your YAML files using `kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f <file.yaml>`.
  - Ensure you are using correct API versions and resource specifications.

- **RBAC Authorization Errors:**
  ```sh
  Error from server (Forbidden): User "system:serviceaccount:default:default" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "default"
  ```
  **Troubleshooting:**
  - Check Role and RoleBinding configurations.
  - Ensure the user or service account has the necessary permissions.

### 7. **Cluster Health Issues**

- **Node Not Ready:**

  ```sh
  Node <node-name> is NotReady
  ```

  **Troubleshooting:**

  - Check node status using `kubectl describe node <node-name>`.
  - Investigate node logs and underlying infrastructure issues.

- **API Server Unreachable:**
  ```sh
  Unable to connect to the server: dial tcp <server-ip>:6443: connect: connection refused
  ```
  **Troubleshooting:**
  - Check the API server status and logs.
  - Ensure network connectivity and correct API server configuration.

### 8. **Resource Quota Issues**

- **Exceeded Resource Quota:**
  ```sh
  Error from server (Forbidden): pods "my-pod" is forbidden: exceeded quota: my-quota, requested: requests.cpu=500m, used: requests.cpu=2, limited: requests.cpu=2
  ```
  **Troubleshooting:**
  - Review resource quotas using `kubectl get quota`.
  - Adjust resource requests or limits, or increase quotas as needed.

### 9. **Deployment Issues**

- **Deployment Not Progressing:**

  ```sh
  Deployment "my-deployment" has timed out progressing.
  ```

  **Troubleshooting:**

  - Check the rollout status using `kubectl rollout status deployment <deployment-name>`.
  - Investigate deployment events and Pod statuses.

- **ReplicaSet Issues:**
  ```sh
  ReplicaSet "my-replicaset" is not available
  ```
  **Troubleshooting:**
  - Check ReplicaSet details using `kubectl describe rs <replicaset-name>`.
  - Ensure sufficient resources and correct configurations.

### Conclusion

These are some of the common types of errors that DevOps engineers face in Kubernetes. Effective troubleshooting often involves checking resource definitions, reviewing logs, validating configurations, and ensuring proper network and storage setups. Regular monitoring and proactive management can help prevent many of these issues.
