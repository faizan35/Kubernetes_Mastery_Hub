# Creating StatefulSets

In Kubernetes, a StatefulSet is created by a **Kubernetes user** or an **automated deployment tool**.

- **Kubernetes User:** Writes manifest file (YAML or JSON) then uses the `kubectl apply` command.

- **Automated Deployment Tool:** In many real-world, StatefulSets are created by tools like **Helm**, Terraform, or custom CI/CD pipelines.

## 1. Creating a Basic StatefulSet YAML File

- Say, file name statefulset.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: example-statefulset
spec:
  serviceName: "example"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: webapp
          image: your-webapp-image:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: data
      spec:
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        storageClassName: "your-storage-class"
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
```

#### Explanation:

- `apiVersion`: Specifies the API version for the Kubernetes resource. In this case, it's `apps/v1`.
- `kind`: Specifies the kind of resource, which is `StatefulSet`.
- `metadata`: Contains metadata about the StatefulSet, including its name.
- `spec`: Defines the desired specification for the StatefulSet.
  - `serviceName`: Specifies the name of the headless service that the StatefulSet controls.
  - `replicas`: Specifies the desired number of replicas (pods).
  - `selector`: Specifies the labels that identify the pods controlled by this StatefulSet.
  - `template`: Defines the pod template used to create the pods.
    - `metadata`: Contains labels for the pods.
    - `spec`: Specifies the pod specification, including containers and their configurations.
  - `volumeClaimTemplates`: Defines the templates for persistent volume claims (PVCs) used by the pods.
    - `metadata`: Contains metadata for the PVC.
    - `spec`: Specifies the access mode, storage class, and resource requirements for the PVC.

### Pod Template Specification:

Define the pod template within the StatefulSet to specify the characteristics of the pods.

```yaml
template:
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: example
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: webapp
        image: your-webapp-image:latest
```

### VolumeClaimTemplates:

Include `volumeClaimTemplates` to configure persistent storage for the StatefulSet. This section defines templates for Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

```yaml
volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: data-volume
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      storageClassName: "your-storage-class"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

## 2. Deploying StatefulSets Using `kubectl`

### `kubectl` Apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -f statefulset.yaml
```

### Verification:

After deploying the StatefulSet, it's essential to verify the creation of pods and resources.

**Verification Commands:**

1.  **Check StatefulSet:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get statefulset example-statefulset
    ```

2.  **List Pods:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -l app=example
    ```

3.  **Inspect Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):**

    ```bash
    kubectl get pvc
    ```

4.  **Describe Pods:**

    ```bash
    kubectl describe pods -l app=example
    ```

By running these verification commands, you can confirm that the StatefulSet has been deployed, pods are running, and associated resources like Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) have been created as intended.

---

## 3. Scaling StatefulSets: `kubectl Scale`

### Scaling Replicas:

```bash
kubectl scale statefulset example-statefulset --replicas=5
```

This command scales the StatefulSet named `example-statefulset` to have 5 replicas.

### Ordinal Indices Maintenance:

- StatefulSets maintain ordinal indices during scaling, **How.?**
- **When scaling up**, new pods are assigned the next available index.
- **When scaling down**, the highest-indexed pods are removed.

---

## 4. Updating StatefulSets: Rolling Updates

- To update the pod template in a StatefulSet, you can modify the StatefulSet's YAML file.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: example-statefulset
spec:
  serviceName: "example"
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: webapp
          image: updated-webapp-image:latest # changed...
```

- After making changes, apply the yaml file.

```bash
kubectl apply -f updated-statefulset.yaml
```

- This triggers the rolling update process.
- Pods are updated one at a time, preserving the stability of the application.

---

## 5 Deleting StatefulSets and Associated Resources

### Deleting a StatefulSet

```bash
kubectl delete statefulset example-statefulset
```

This command deletes the StatefulSet named `example-statefulset`.

### Delete PVs and PVCs

- Deleting a StatefulSet alone does not automatically delete the associated PVs and PVCs.
- To delete them.

- **Delete PVCs:**

  ```bash
  kubectl delete pvc -l app=example
  ```

- **Delete PVs** (only if dynamically provisioned):

  ```bash
  kubectl delete pv -l app=example
  ```

If the PVs were dynamically provisioned, deleting the PVCs might also trigger the deletion of the corresponding PVs, depending on the storage class's reclaim policy.
