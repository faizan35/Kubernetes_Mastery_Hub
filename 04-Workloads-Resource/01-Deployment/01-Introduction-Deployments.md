# 4.1.1. Introduction to Deployments

**Official k8s Docs:** https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/

### **1. What is a Deployment?**

- A Deployment in Kubernetes is a higher-level abstraction that manages the lifecycle of pods.
- A Deployment in Kubernetes is like a manager that manages the lifecycle of pods.
- We define the desired state, and its continuously monitors the current state to meet the desired state.

#### OR

- <h4 style="display: inline;">Deployments</h4> is a declarative way to <h5 style="display: inline;">automate and manage the containerized applications</h5> to maintain a specified desired state, through ReplicaSet.

- Deployments are <u>**abstraction layer above ReplicaSets**</u>, providing declarative updates, rolling updates, and rollbacks.

- When you create a **Deployment**, Kubernetes creates a **ReplicaSet**, which in turn manages the Pods.

- The **Deployment controller** continually **monitors** the state of the ReplicaSet, to match the desired state specified in the Deployment manifest.

#### What ReplicaSet do..?

: - ReplicaSet keep a specific number of replicas running at all times.
: - If one crashes, it quickly replaces it to maintain the desired number.

#### Deployments (boss):

: - is like a boss that watches over these replicas.
: - It make's sure these replicas are doing exactly what you want, even when you're making changes.

### **2. Why Use Deployments?**

- **Declarative Updates**: You describe the desired state, and K8s ensures that the current state matches that desired state.

- **Scalability**: You can easily scale your application by increasing or decreasing the number of `replicas`.

- **Self-healing:** Deployments automatically replace failed pods and maintain the desired state.

- **Rolling Updates:** Easily update your application without downtime using rolling updates.

- **Rollbacks:** It track changes and allow you to roll back to previous versions if something goes wrong during an update.

### **3. Creating Deployment YAML file**

#### With `kubectl create` command

```sh
kubectl create deployment my-deployment --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

**Output:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: my-deployment
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-deployment
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: my-deployment
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: nginx
          name: nginx
          resources: {}
status: {}
```

#### For help

```sh
kubectl create deployment --help
```

#### Few Deployments Commands

##### Apply the Deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

##### Check the Deployment:

```bash
kubectl get deployment
```

##### Observe ReplicaSets:

```bash
kubectl get replicaset
```

### 7. Scaling a Deployments

- You can scale a Deployment horizontally by adjusting the number of replicas in the Deployment manifest.
- Kubernetes will automatically adjust the number of Pods to match the desired number of replicas.

### 8. Health Checks and Liveness Probes:

- Deployments can be configured with health checks and liveness probes to ensure the application's health.

- Health checks determine if a pod is ready to serve traffic, while liveness probes determine if a pod is alive and healthy.

### 9. Cleaning Up:

- Deleting a Deployment removes all the resources it manages (ReplicaSet, Pods, etc.).
- You can delete a Deployment using `kubectl delete deployment <deployment_name>`.

### 10. Best Practices:

- Use declarative configurations stored in version control.
- Utilize labels effectively to organize and manage Deployments.
- Regularly test your Deployment updates and rollback procedures.

## Interview Questions

Q) How does Kubernetes manage resource cleanup in Deployments? **OR** What policies or configurations can be set to manage old ReplicaSets and ensure resource efficiency?

A) By allowing configuration of the `revisionHistoryLimit` field to specify how many old ReplicaSets should be retained. This ensures efficient resource utilization and prevents cluttering of resources.

Q) Can you discuss any best practices or recommendations for optimizing Deployments in Kubernetes? How would you ensure the efficient management and operation of Deployments in a production environment?

A) Best practices for optimizing Deployments in Kubernetes include defining resource limits and requests, using **liveness** and **readiness** probes effectively, monitoring resource utilization, implementing health checks, and automating deployments with CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, ensuring proper configuration of scaling policies and cleanup strategies contributes to efficient management of Deployments in a production environment.
