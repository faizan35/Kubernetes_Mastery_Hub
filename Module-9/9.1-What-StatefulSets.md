# StatefulSets

## What is StatefulSets.?

- It manages the deployment and scaling of a set of pods, but with a **focus on** maintaining a stable and unique identity for each pod.
- It dose same work as Deployments (its for stateless applications), BUT for stateful applications.
- It just like Deployments + it maintains unique identity of Pods.

### Stateless vs Stateful

| **Characteristic**   | **Stateless**                                         | **Stateful**                                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Persistence** | Ephemeral; Data is not retained between sessions.     | Persistent; Data is maintained across sessions.                        |
| **Network Identity** | Dynamic; Instances can have changing identities.      | Stable; Instances have consistent and unique identities.               |
| **Scaling**          | Horizontally scalable; Instances are interchangeable. | Ordered scaling; Instances may have dependencies on startup order.     |
| **Use Cases**        | Web servers, microservices, stateless applications.   | Databases, messaging systems, applications with stateful requirements. |

### Deployments vs StatefulSets

|                   | **Deployments**                                                                                                 | **StatefulSets**                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Category**      | Best for stateless applications                                                                                 | Ideal for stateful applications                                                                                 |
| **Best for**      | Stateless applications                                                                                          | Applications that require persistent storage and stable network identities                                      |
| **Suited for**    | Scalable, ephemeral workloads                                                                                   | Suited for databases, messaging systems, and applications with dependencies on ordered scaling or startup order |
| **Efficient for** | Web servers, microservices, and applications without strict data persistence or ordered deployment requirements | Databases, messaging systems, and applications with dependencies on ordered scaling or startup order            |
| **Use Cases**     | E-commerce platforms, Blogs, Content Delivery Networks                                                          | MySQL databases, Apache Kafka, Legacy applications with stateful requirements                                   |

### Use Cases for StatefulSets in Stateful Applications

1.  **Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL):**

    - Ideal for databases, ensuring data consistency and ordered scaling. Each instance has a stable network identity for seamless communication.

2.  **Messaging Systems (e.g., Apache Kafka):**

    - Beneficial for message queues like Apache Kafka.
    - Stable network identity and persistent storage ensure reliable messaging even during pod rescheduling.

3.  **Distributed File Systems (e.g., Ceph, GlusterFS):**

    - Well-suited for distributed file systems, providing stable identities and persistent storage for shared data.

4.  **Legacy Applications with Stateful Requirements:**

    - Facilitates transitioning or maintaining compatibility with legacy applications relying on stateful deployment models.

#### Benefits:

1.  **Stable Network Identities:**

    - Each pod gets a unique, stable hostname, crucial for consistent communication between instances.

2.  **Persistent Storage:**

    - Utilizes Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for data persistence across rescheduling or replacements.

3.  **Ordered Scaling:**

    - Maintains order during deployment and scaling, beneficial for applications with startup dependencies.

4.  **Headless Service for DNS-Based Discovery:**

    - Automatically creates a headless service, enabling DNS-based service discovery for easy communication between pods.
