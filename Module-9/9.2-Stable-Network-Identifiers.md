# Stable Network Identifiers

- Stable Network Identifiers is a naming convention for pods within a set.

### Why Stable Network Identities Needed in Stateful Applications.?

- Stable network identities are like having **nametags** for each Pod that never changes.

### How it Hepls.?

- **Communication Confidence:** Pods know where to find each other, ensuring they can communicate.

- **Order:** With proper names Pods are in order.

- **Avoiding Mistakes:** With proper names NO mistakes.

- **Easier Maintenance:** Updating or scaling the application is simplified.

### Generation of nametags:

- In StatefulSets, Pods are named by combining the **StatefulSet name** with an **ordinal index**.
- Each pod created by the StatefulSet is named `<statefulset-name>-<ordinal-index>`.

  - `<statefulset-name>`: Represents the name of the StatefulSet managing the pods.
  - `<ordinal-index>`: Represents a numeric index assigned to each pod, reflecting its order within the StatefulSet.

- **For example**, if you have a StatefulSet named "**webapp**" the pods created by this StatefulSet might be named "**webapp-0**" "**webapp-1**" and so on. Here, "webapp" is the StatefulSet name, and the numeric indices (0, 1, etc.) are the ordinal indices assigned to each pod.

Ordinal Indices:
: refer to numeric identifiers assigned to pods based on their order of creation or scaling within the StatefulSet.

## Checking Stable Network Identifiers

### Command Line Exploration:

Using `kubectl` commands, we can explore and inspect the stable network identifiers of pods in a running StatefulSet.

1.  **Inspecting StatefulSet Pods:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -l app=<statefulset-name>
    ```

    This command retrieves information about the pods managed by a specific StatefulSet.

2.  **Viewing Pod Details:**

    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
    ```

    The `describe` command provides detailed information about a specific pod, including its stable network identifier.

### Pod Rescheduling:

Demonstrating how stable identities are maintained during pod rescheduling involves simulating a scenario where a pod is terminated and replaced.

1.  **Scaling Down:**

    ```bash
    kubectl scale statefulset <statefulset-name> --replicas=0
    ```

    This scales down the StatefulSet, terminating the pods.

2.  **Scaling Up:**

    ```bash
    kubectl scale statefulset <statefulset-name> --replicas=<desired-replica-count>
    ```

    Scaling up the StatefulSet creates new pods to meet the desired replica count.

3.  **Checking Stable Identifiers:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -l app=<statefulset-name>
    ```

    Inspect the stable network identifiers of the newly created pods. The ordinal index should continue from the last assigned index.
