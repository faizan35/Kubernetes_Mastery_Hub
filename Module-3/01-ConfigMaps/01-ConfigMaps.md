## What are ConfigMaps?

- Used for storing non-sensitive configuration data, such as environment variables, configuration files, or any key-value pairs.
- Data is in clear text and doesn't provide any encryption or security features.
- Suitable for sharing configuration across multiple pods and containers.
- Example use case: Storing application configuration files, environment variables.

## ConfigMaps Use Cases:

**1. Application Configuration:**

- **Scenario:** You have a microservices-based application with multiple components requiring different configuration settings.
- **Use Case:** Create ConfigMaps for each microservice, storing configuration parameters like database connection strings, API endpoints, and feature flags.

**2\. Environment Variables:**

- **Scenario:** Your application relies on environment variables for runtime configuration.
- **Use Case:** Use ConfigMaps to define environment variables and inject them into your application pods. This ensures consistency across different environments (dev, staging, production).

**3\. Non-sensitive Data Storage:**

- **Scenario:** Storing non-sensitive data that needs to be shared across containers or pods.
- **Use Case:** ConfigMaps can hold non-sensitive data such as static files, configuration files, or any data that multiple containers within a pod need access to.

## Creating ConfigMaps:

ConfigMaps can be created using `kubectl` command-line tool or through YAML manifests.
You can create a ConfigMap from literal values, files, or directories.

## Viewing ConfigMaps:

You can view ConfigMaps using `kubectl get configmaps` command.
To see details of a specific ConfigMap: `kubectl describe configmap <configmap-name>`.

## Using ConfigMaps:

ConfigMaps can be used by referencing them in pod specifications.
You can inject ConfigMap data into a pod's environment variables or volumes.

## **Updating ConfigMaps:**

- You can update ConfigMaps using `kubectl edit configmap <configmap-name>` or by applying a new YAML manifest.

## **Deleting ConfigMaps:**

- To delete a ConfigMap: `kubectl delete configmap <configmap-name>`.

## Injecting ConfigMap Data into Environment Variables:

```yaml
env:
  - name: ENV_VARIABLE
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: my-config
        key: key1
```

## Injecting ConfigMap Data into Volumes:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: my-config
```

## **Best Practices:**

- Avoid storing sensitive data in ConfigMaps., use **Secret**.
- Use ConfigMaps for configurations that are not expected to change frequently.
- Consider using tools like Helm for managing more complex configurations.
