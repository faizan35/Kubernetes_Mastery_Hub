# Kubernetes Pods

#### files -> image -> container -> pod

### 1. What is a Pod?

Definition:
: A pod is a smallest unit in the Kubernetes object model and is the basic building block of a Kubernetes application.
: Think of it as a group of containers who always stick together and share things.

Purpose:
: Provides a cohesive unit for <u>deploying and managing containers</u>.

### 2. Things inside Pod

#### i) Containers

- Pods can have one or more tightly coupled containers. (they are inside Pods)
- Containers within the same pod share common storage volumes and network namespace.
- Each pods have unique IP address so, containers can communicate to each other over localhost.

#### ii) Init Containers

- Special containers that run before the main application containers, **performing setup tasks**.
- It's like a friend who arranges the game before everyone else joins.

#### iii) Ephemeral Containers

- Temporary containers for **debugging purposes**, injected into a running Pod when needed.
- Its like a friend who is not playing but can be called if anything goes worng, or like an umpire in cricket.

### Pods go through various phases:

- **Pending**: The Pod is accepted by the system, and resources are being allocated.
- **Running**: All containers in the Pod are running, and at least one is in the running phase.
- **Succeeded**: All containers in the Pod have terminated successfully.
- **Failed**: All containers in the Pod have terminated, and at least one container has failed.
- **Unknown**: The state of the Pod cannot be determined.

## Multi-container Pods

Pods that host more than one container.

### Benefits:

- **Efficient Communication**: Containers share resources like volumes, IPC, and network namespace.
- **Data Locality**: Access shared resources locally, reducing latency.
- **Tightly Coupled Management**: Orchestrated as a single unit for simplified operations.

### Communication:

- **Shared Volumes**: Persistent storage for data exchange.
- **IPC Namespace**: Containers share IPC namespace, facilitating communication.
- **Network Namespace**: Containers use same network namespace, simplifying communication over localhost.

### Use Cases:

- **Sidecar Containers**: Using other container as, log watchers or monitoring, without bothering the main container.
- **Proxies/Adapters**: Using other container as, proxies, bridges, or adapters connecting the main container with external services or networks, thus improving communication and integration capabilities.
- **Modular Applications**: Modular Applications means, an application which is built with multiple small block or containers, so each team can work on their own container, it encourage code reuse and collaboration among teams.
