# Authentication & Authorization

Let's say you want to go inside a water park.

## Authentication

- Think of **authentication** as verifying your identity at the door before entering the park.
- In Kubernetes, it's like showing your ID card or providing some proof to access the cluster.

## Authorization

- Authorization is like deciding what you can do once you're inside the park., in which rides you can go.
- In Kubernetes, it's about setting permissions and saying, "Hey, you can do this, but not that."

## Why do we need these in Kubernetes.?

Imagine if anyone could get access to our Kubernetes cluster and mess with our apps or data! **It'd be chaos!** Authentication and authorization keep things in check. They make sure only the right people or programs can access our cluster and only do what they're allowed to do.
