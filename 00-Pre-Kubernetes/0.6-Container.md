# Container - Docker, Podman, OCI, CRI

## Container

A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

## Docker and Podman

- Docker and Podman are containerization platforms that allow you to create, deploy, and manage containers.

- **Docker** is one of the most popular containerization platforms, known for its simplicity and ease of use.

- **Podman** is an alternative to Docker, gaining popularity due to its focus on security and compatibility with Docker.

## Open Container Initiative (OCI)

- OCI is like a rulebook, for the container's.

- K8s can mannage containers easily and with no issue, if containers are made with all the OCI standards.

## Container Runtime Interface (CRI)

- CRI is an **API**.

- So, with this API, K8s can communicate with containers.
