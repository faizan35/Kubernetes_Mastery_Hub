# YAML Syntax

- Familiarize yourself with YAML syntax, as Kubernetes manifests are typically written in YAML.

### 1. **Indentation:**

- YAML uses indentation to represent the structure of data. Spaces, not tabs, are used for indentation.
- Nested elements are indented with spaces.

### 2. **Key-Value Pairs:**

- Data is represented as key-value pairs separated by a colon.
- Example:

```yaml
key: value
```

### 3. **Lists or Array:**

- Lists or Array are represented using a **hyphen** (**`-`**) followed by a space.
- Example:

```yaml
fruits:
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange
```

### 4. **Nested Structures:**

- YAML allows for nested structures using indentation.
- Example:

```yaml
person:
  name: John
  age: 30
  address:
    city: New York
    street: 123 Main St
```

- Address of `city`: `person.addresss.city`

### 5. **Comments:**

- Comments in YAML start with the `#` symbol.
- Example:

```yaml
# This is a comment
key: value
```

### 6. **Quoting:**

- Strings in YAML don't necessarily need quotes, but you can use single or double quotes.
- Example:

```yaml
string1: "single-quoted"
string2: "double-quoted"
```

### 7. **Special Characters:**

- Be cautious with special characters. If a string contains special characters, it's recommended to use quotes.
- Example:

```yaml
message: "This is a special: char"
```

### 8. **Anchors and Aliases:**

- YAML supports anchors and aliases to reuse elements.
- Depends what you want to re-use
  - Value = just by `*`.
  - Block = key = `<<` : `*`
- Example:

  ```yaml
  common_greeting: &greeting Hello, welcome to our application!

  development:
  greeting_message: *greeting
  debug_mode: true

  production:
  greeting_message: *greeting
  debug_mode: false
  ```

  ##### It will look like this.

  ```yaml
  development:
  greeting_message: Hello, welcome to our application!
  debug_mode: true

  production:
  greeting_message: Hello, welcome to our application!
  debug_mode: false
  ```

  #### Or

  ```yaml
  # Anchors and Aliases Example
  details: &personDetails
  name: John
  age: 30
  address:
      city: New York
      street: 123 Main St

  # Reusing the anchored details
  employee1:
  <<: *personDetails
  position: Developer

  employee2:
  <<: *personDetails
  position: Designer
  ```

  ##### It will look like this.

  ```yaml
  employee1:
  name: John
  age: 30
  address:
      city: New York
      street: 123 Main St
  position: Developer

  employee2:
  name: John
  age: 30
  address:
      city: New York
      street: 123 Main St
  position: Designer
  ```

Understanding YAML syntax is crucial for working with Kubernetes manifests, where you define resources like pods, services, and deployments. It's a pretty straightforward format once you get the hang of it!
