# API

## API (Application Programming Interface)

- It is the mode of communication between two programs or software.

## RESTful API

- If the communication happens through the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD, its called RESTful API.

## gRPC API

- If the communication happens through the standard HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers for serialization, its called gRPC API.
- Developed by Google
- Unlike RESTful APIs, which use HTTP and are typically text-based (e.g., JSON), gRPC APIs use binary protocols for faster and more efficient communication.
- It is more efficient and suitable for high-performance, real-time applications.
- gRPC APIs provide features such as bidirectional streaming, authentication, and more.

## What is the role of RESTful API in kubernetes.?

- Kubernetes uses RESTful APIs for communication between its components.

- When you interact with Kubernetes, whether you're deploying applications, scaling resources, or checking the status of your cluster, you're essentially sending requests to its **API server** using RESTful API calls.

## What about gRPC APIs for Kubernetes.?

- Kubernetes itself primarily uses RESTful APIs.

- BUT in areas like networking and service communication, where **gRPC** comes into play.

- Understanding gRPC APIs can give you deeper insights into these aspects of Kubernetes and help you optimize performance when needed.
