# Key Value Store

A **Key-Value Store** is a type of **NoSQL** (Not Only SQL) database that stores data in a schema-less way, where each piece of data is associated with a unique key, which is used to retrieve the corresponding value.

## Why are Key-Value Stores important for Kubernetes?

They help keep track of things like configuration data (think of it as the settings for your app), service discovery (finding out where things are in your cluster), and managing the overall state of the cluster itself.
