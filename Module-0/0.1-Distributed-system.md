# 0.1 Distributed system & CAP Theorem

## Distributed Systems

A distributed system is a network of independent computers that work together to achieve a common goal. They communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages through a network.

- like teamwork among computers.

### Use Cases of Distributed Systems in Modern IT Infrastructure

- Cloud Computing platforms,
- Big Data processing frameworks (e.g., Hadoop, Spark),
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs),
- Microservices Architectures, and more.

## CAP Theorem or Brewer's theorem

CAP theorem tell, how we design and operate distributed systems.

- The CAP theorem, states that it's impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than **two out of three** guarantees:

1.  **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
2.  **Availability**: Every request receives a response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
3.  **Partition tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network partitions or communication failures between nodes.

- So, **Sometimes you need to sacrifice one thing to ensure another.**

## How is it related to Kubernetes.?

- In Kubernetes, all the **nodes** in a cluster collectively behave like a **distributed system**.

- we need to understand how distributed systems operate, their challenges, and how we make decisions about them.

- It's like understanding the game before you play.
