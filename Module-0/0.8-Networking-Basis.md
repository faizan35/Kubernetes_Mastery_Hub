# Networking Basis

1.  **CIDR Notation & Type of IP Addresses**:

    - CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a way to represent a range of IP addresses. It's important in Kubernetes because it helps in defining IP address ranges for Pods and Services within the cluster.

2.  **L2, L3, L4 & L7 Layers (OSI Layers)**:

    - These refer to different layers in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model which defines networking protocols. In Kubernetes, understanding these layers helps in troubleshooting network issues, implementing network policies, and ensuring smooth communication between different components.

3.  **SSL/TLS: One way & Mutual TLS**:

    - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication over a computer network. In Kubernetes, they are crucial for securing connections between various components and ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

4.  **Proxy**:

    - A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and servers. In Kubernetes, proxies are used for load balancing, routing traffic, and providing access to Services running within the cluster.

5.  **DNS**:

    - Domain Name System (DNS) is used to translate domain names into IP addresses. In Kubernetes, DNS resolution is essential for discovering Services and Pods within the cluster by their domain names.

6.  **IPVS/IPTables/NFtables**:

    - These are different technologies for packet filtering and routing in Linux. In Kubernetes, they are used for implementing network policies, load balancing, and managing traffic within the cluster.

7.  **Software Defined Networking (SDN)**:

    - SDN is an approach to networking that uses software-based controllers to manage network traffic and services. In Kubernetes, SDN solutions provide advanced networking capabilities such as network segmentation, service discovery, and load balancing.

8.  **Virtual Interfaces**:

    - Virtual interfaces are software-based network interfaces that can be created and managed by the operating system. In Kubernetes, virtual interfaces are used for connecting Pods to the network and enabling communication between different Pods and Services.

9.  **Overlay networking**:

    - Overlay networking is a technique used to create virtual network overlays on top of an existing physical network infrastructure. In Kubernetes, overlay networking allows Pods running on different nodes to communicate with each other seamlessly, regardless of the underlying network topology.

Understanding these networking concepts is crucial for effectively deploying, managing, and troubleshooting Kubernetes clusters. It enables efficient communication between Pods and Services, ensures security and scalability, and facilitates the smooth operation of containerized applications.
