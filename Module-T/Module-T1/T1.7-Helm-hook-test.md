# Helm hooks & Helm Test

## Helm hooks

Helm hooks are a feature introduced in Helm v3 to allow for executing Kubernetes resources at certain points during the Helm lifecycle. These hooks enable users to perform various actions, such as running scripts, creating Kubernetes resources, or interacting with external systems, before or after specific Helm actions like install, upgrade, or delete.

Here's an overview of Helm hooks:

1.  **Types of Hooks**:

    - **Pre-install and Post-install Hooks**: Execute actions before or after installing a chart.
    - **Pre-upgrade and Post-upgrade Hooks**: Execute actions before or after upgrading a release.
    - **Pre-delete and Post-delete Hooks**: Execute actions before or after deleting a release.

2.  **Hook Execution**:

    - Hooks are defined in the `templates/` directory of a Helm chart.
    - Each hook is defined in a separate YAML file.
    - Helm recognizes hooks based on their annotations and labels.
    - Helm executes hooks in a predefined order during the corresponding Helm action.
    - Helm waits for hooks to complete before continuing with the Helm action.

3.  **Annotations and Labels**:

    - Helm identifies hooks using annotations and labels in the YAML files.
    - Annotations specify the type and phase of the hook (`helm.sh/hook` and `helm.sh/hook-weight`).
    - Labels are used for selector matching and can be used to group related hooks.

4.  **Hook Templates**:

    - Hook templates are standard Kubernetes manifests (e.g., Deployment, Job, Pod) written in YAML.
    - They can contain any valid Kubernetes resource definition.
    - Helm processes hook templates along with other templates during chart rendering.

5.  **Common Use Cases**:

    - **Database Schema Initialization**: Run database schema migrations or setup scripts before deploying an application.
    - **Service Dependency Check**: Ensure that dependent services are available before deploying an application.
    - **Secret or ConfigMap Injection**: Populate secrets or ConfigMaps dynamically during chart installation.
    - **Post-Deployment Verification**: Perform health checks or integration tests after deploying an application.

6.  **Limitations**:

    - Hook execution order is not customizable.
    - Rollback behavior for failed hooks can be complex and requires manual intervention.
    - Hooks are tied to the Helm release lifecycle and may not provide full lifecycle management for all scenarios.

### Scenario where hooks are useful

One scenario where hooks are useful is when deploying a microservices-based application with multiple components. Let's say you have a web application and a corresponding database.

You can use a pre-install hook to ensure that the necessary database schema is initialized before deploying the web application. This hook can run database migration scripts or setup tasks to prepare the database schema. By using hooks, you can automate this process, ensuring that the database is ready before deploying the web application, thus avoiding potential deployment failures due to missing database schema or configuration.

## Helm Test

- Just like you create unit test cases for your application, its like the same.

Helm provides a feature called "Helm tests," which allows you to define and run tests for your Helm charts after they've been deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. These tests help ensure that your application is functioning correctly within the Kubernetes environment. Helm tests are particularly useful for validating the deployment, configuration, and behavior of your application.

Here's an overview of Helm tests:

1.  **Test Definition**:

    - Helm tests are defined within a Helm chart in a separate YAML file named `tests/test-<name>.yaml`.
    - Each test specifies the commands or scripts to run, along with expected outcomes or assertions.

2.  **Test Execution**:

    - After deploying a Helm release, Helm automatically runs the tests associated with the chart.
    - Helm creates a Kubernetes Job or Pod to execute the test commands within the cluster.
    - The test results are captured and reported back to the user.

3.  **Test Types**:

    - **Command Tests**: Execute shell commands within a test container to validate functionality or behavior.
    - **Script Tests**: Run custom test scripts or binaries within the cluster to perform more complex validations.
    - **HTTP Tests**: Send HTTP requests to application endpoints and verify responses for HTTP-based services.

4.  **Test Assertions**:

    - Tests typically include assertions to verify that the application behaves as expected.
    - Assertions can check for the presence of resources, specific outputs, or the absence of errors.
    - Helm provides mechanisms for capturing test output and determining the success or failure of tests based on predefined criteria.

5.  **Test Results**:

    - Helm captures the output and status of each test execution.
    - Test results are reported back to the user after the test job or pod completes.
    - Users can review test logs and statuses to identify any failures or issues.

6.  **Continuous Integration (CI)**:

    - Helm tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing process.
    - CI tools can execute Helm commands to install or upgrade charts and monitor test results for each deployment.

7.  **Common Use Cases**:

    - **Health Checks**: Verify that application components are healthy and responsive.
    - **Configuration Validation**: Ensure that configuration values are applied correctly.
    - **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between different components or services.
    - **End-to-End Testing**: Validate end-to-end functionality of applications deployed on Kubernetes.
