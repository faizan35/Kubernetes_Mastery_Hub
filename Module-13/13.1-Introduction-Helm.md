# Introduction to Helm

### What is Helm?

- Helm is a **package manager** for Kubernetes applications.
- It simplifies and streamlines the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications by packaging them into **charts**.

Helm chart
: is a collection of pre-configured Kubernetes resources that can be easily deployed and managed as a single unit.

### **Why use Helm?**

- **Reusability:** Helm packages applications and dependencies into reusable **charts**, in a way that's easy to share and deploy.
- **Versioning:** Helm charts can be versioned, making it simple to track changes and upgrade or roll back applications.
- **Templating:** Helm uses **Go**(the programming language) templating to dynamically generate Kubernetes manifest files, enabling configuration flexibility without duplicating code.
- **Simplified Deployment:** Helm manages releases, making complex deployments in Kubernetes clusters easier to handle.

### **Comparison with native Kubernetes manifests:**

| Aspect                        | Native K8s Manifests                         | Helm Charts                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Configuration Type**        | Static YAML files                            | Higher abstraction with dynamic configuration using Go templating     |
| **Efficiency and Modularity** | Cumbersome for managing growing applications | Efficient application management, promoting modularity and code reuse |
| **Versioning**                | External versioning                          | Inherent versioning for easier change tracking and release management |
