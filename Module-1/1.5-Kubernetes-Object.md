# Kubernetes Object

- When we talk about **Kubernetes objects**, we're referring to configurations that you write in a **manifest file**.
- It is like a digital blueprint that tells Kubernetes how to manage and run your applications.
- It is written in YAML or JSON format and contains the specifications for the **desired state** of your application or workload.
- Any object you create, gets stored in `etcd`. under the key named `/registry` dir.

## Key Characteristics of Kubernetes Objects:

### Declarative Configuration:

- When you write the manifest file, means you are **declaring the desired state** rather than giving steps to achieve it.

### Desired State Specification:

- You describe how you want your apps to run **(desired state)**.

### Immutable:

- means, Once you are up and running, you don't directly change them. Instead, you create new version of existing ones.
- It's like updating your profile pictureâ€”instead of changing the old one, you upload a new and improved version.

### Self-Healing:

- Kubernetes continuously monitors the cluster and insures that the **current state** matches the **desired state**.
