# Kubernetes

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration tool that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, simplifying complex tasks and optimizing performance in distributed computing environments.

## What is Container Orchestration With Analogy

**It is like a manager for containers.**

- When we run a container without Container Orchestration, like `k8s` it is un-managed.
- like it the container is stopped due to some error the whole application stops we have to re-start it manually.
- and in case of `k8s`, it will be re-started automatically.

#### Analogy

Think of container orchestration as the director of a movie production. Containers are like individual actors, each playing a role in the overall film (application). The director (orchestrator) manages the entire production, ensuring that actors are in the right place at the right time (deployment), adjusting the scene setup as needed (scaling), and making sure everything runs smoothly to create a blockbuster performance (optimized application performance).

**What is what:**

- **Containers are like actors:** Each container plays a specific role or function in the overall application, just like actors play characters in a movie.

- **Container Orchestration (Kubernetes) is like the director:** The orchestration platform takes on the role of the director, managing and coordinating the containers (actors) to ensure they perform their tasks according to the script (application configuration). It handles deployment, scaling, and overall coordination to create a seamless and well-orchestrated performance (application execution).
