# 1.2 Kubernetes Architecture Components

Kubernetes operates on a **master-worker architecture**, commonly referred to as the **control plane** and **node** components.

#### Control Plane Components or Master Node

- API Server
- etcd
- Controller Manager
- Scheduler

#### Node Components or Worker Node

- Kubelet
- Kube-proxy
- Container Runtime

## Control Plane Components or Master Node:

### **API Server:**

- Acts as the **entry point** for all administrative tasks.
- **Function:**: Receives requests from `users`, `kubectl`, and other components, processes REST operations, and serves as the communication hub for the **control plane**.

### **etcd:**

- It act as a storage unit for the **cluster**.
- **Function:**:
  - It stores the **desired state** of the entire cluster.
  - The master components read from and write to `etcd` to maintain consistency and keep track of the **cluster's configuration**.
  - It stores all the information about your clusterâ€”what nodes are part of the cluster, what pods are running, what their statuses are, and more.

### **Controller Manager:**

- Its Job is to monitors the state of the cluster through the API server.
- **Function:**:
  - Ensures that the current state of the cluster matches the desired state by creating, updating, or deleting resources (such as Pods and Services).
  - It includes various controllers like the Node Controller, Replication Controller, and Endpoints Controller.

### **Scheduler:**

- **Role:** Listens for Pod creation events from the API server.
- **Function:**: Assigns Pods to available nodes based on resource requirements, policies, and constraints. It's responsible for optimizing the distribution of workloads across the cluster.
- When you ask for a container to be run, the Scheduler decides which machine (Node) in your cluster should run it.

## Node Components or Worker Node:

### **Kubelet:**

- It communicates with the control plane `API server` (the Boss).
- **Function:**:
  - Its job is to ensure that all the pods are running in that Node.
  - It receives Pod specifications from the API server and works to maintain the desired state of Pods on a node.

### **Kube-proxy:**

- It manages the internal and external networking on the nodes.

- **Function:**
  - Enabling communication between Pods and external traffic.
  - Implements the Kubernetes Service concept by ensuring that each Pod gets its unique IP address.

### **Container Runtime:**

- Responsible for running containers lifecycle.

- **Function:**
  - Responsible for pulling container images, running containers, and managing their lifecycle.
