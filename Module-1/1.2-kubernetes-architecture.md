# 1.2 Kubernetes Architecture Components

Kubernetes operates on a **master-worker architecture**, commonly referred to as the **control plane** and **node** components.

## Control Plane Components or Master Node:

### API Server:

- **Role:** Acts as the **entry point** for all administrative tasks. Like **Front gate**.
- **Function:**: Receives requests from `users`, `kubectl`, and other components, processes REST operations, and serves as the communication hub for the **control plane**.

### etcd:

- **Role:** Persistent storage for the **cluster's configuration data**. like the cluster's **brain**.
- **Function:**: Stores the desired state of the entire cluster. The master components read from and write to `etcd` to maintain consistency and keep track of the **cluster's configuration**.
- It stores all the information about your clusterâ€”what nodes are part of the cluster, what pods are running, what their statuses are, and more.

### Controller Manager:

- **Role:** Monitors the state of the cluster through the API server. as the cluster's **brain manager**.
- **Function:**: Ensures that the current state of the cluster matches the desired state by creating, updating, or deleting resources (such as Pods and Services). It includes various controllers like the Node Controller, Replication Controller, and Endpoints Controller.
- Watches the change-in state of the cluster through the API server.

### Scheduler:

- **Role:** Listens for Pod creation events from the API server. like a **matchmaker** for your containers.
- **Function:**: Assigns Pods to available nodes based on resource requirements, policies, and constraints. It's responsible for optimizing the distribution of workloads across the cluster.
- When you ask for a container to be run, the Scheduler decides which machine (Node) in your cluster should run it.

## Node Components or Worker Node:

### Kubelet:

- This is the **manager** or **watchdog**for each worker node.
- It ensures that all containers are running in a Pod.
- Communicates with the control plane components to receive instructions and report the node's status.
- Handles tasks like starting, stopping, and maintaining application containers based on Pod specifications.

### Kube-proxy:

- Think of it as a **traffic cop** or **network proxy**.
- It maintains network rules on nodes.
- Enabling communication between Pods and external traffic.
- Implements the Kubernetes Service concept by ensuring that each Pod gets its unique IP address.

### Container Runtime:

- Responsible for running containers.
- `Docker` is commonly used, but other runtimes like `containerd` can also be used.
- It's responsible for running containers, handling images, and managing their lifecycle.

5. Kubelet:

**Role:** Communicates with the control plane components.
**Function:**: Ensures that containers in a Pod are running and healthy. It receives Pod specifications from the API server and works to maintain the desired state of Pods on a node.

6. Kube-proxy:

**Role:** Maintains network rules on nodes.
**Function:**: Enables communication between Pods and facilitates the exposure of Services to the external world. It helps in load balancing network traffic to ensure proper routing.

7. Container Runtime:

**Role:** Responsible for pulling container images, running containers, and managing their lifecycle.
**Function:**: Executes and manages containers based on the specifications provided. It interacts with the underlying infrastructure to create, start, stop, and delete containers.
