# 1.2 Kubernetes Architecture Components

Kubernetes operates on a **master-worker architecture**, commonly referred to as the **control plane** and **node** components.

## Control Plane Components or Master Node:

### API Server:

- **Role:** Acts as the **entry point** for all administrative tasks. Like **Front gate**.
- **Function:**: Receives requests from `users`, `kubectl`, and other components, processes REST operations, and serves as the communication hub for the **control plane**.

### etcd:

- **Role:** Persistent storage for the cluster's configuration data. like the cluster's **brain**.
- **Function:**: Stores the desired state of the entire cluster. The master components read from and write to `etcd` to maintain consistency and keep track of the **cluster's configuration**.
- It stores all the information about your cluster—what nodes are part of the cluster, what pods are running, what their statuses are, and more.

### Controller Manager:

- **Role:** Monitors the state of the cluster through the API server. as the cluster's **brain manager**.
- **Function:**: Ensures that the current state of the cluster matches the desired state by creating, updating, or deleting resources (such as Pods and Services). It includes various controllers like the Node Controller, Replication Controller, and Endpoints Controller.
- Watches the change-in state of the cluster through the API server.

### Scheduler:

- **Role:** Listens for Pod creation events from the API server. like a **matchmaker** for your containers.
- **Function:**: Assigns Pods to available nodes based on resource requirements, policies, and constraints. It's responsible for optimizing the distribution of workloads across the cluster.
- When you ask for a container to be run, the Scheduler decides which machine (Node) in your cluster should run it.

## Node Components or Worker Node:

### Kubelet:

- This is the **manager** or **watchdog**for each worker node.
- It ensures that all containers are running in a Pod.
- Communicates with the control plane components to receive instructions and report the node's status.
- Handles tasks like starting, stopping, and maintaining application containers based on Pod specifications.

### Kube-proxy:

- Think of it as a **traffic cop** or **network proxy**.
- It maintains network rules on nodes.
- Enabling communication between Pods and external traffic.
- Implements the Kubernetes Service concept by ensuring that each Pod gets its unique IP address.

### Container Runtime:

- Responsible for running containers.
- `Docker` is commonly used, but other runtimes like `containerd` can also be used.
- It's responsible for running containers, handling images, and managing their lifecycle.

5. Kubelet:

**Role:** Communicates with the control plane components.
**Function:**: Ensures that containers in a Pod are running and healthy. It receives Pod specifications from the API server and works to maintain the desired state of Pods on a node.

6. Kube-proxy:

**Role:** Maintains network rules on nodes.
**Function:**: Enables communication between Pods and facilitates the exposure of Services to the external world. It helps in load balancing network traffic to ensure proper routing.

7. Container Runtime:

**Role:** Responsible for pulling container images, running containers, and managing their lifecycle.
**Function:**: Executes and manages containers based on the specifications provided. It interacts with the underlying infrastructure to create, start, stop, and delete containers.

## Other Components

### Pod

- The smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model.
- Represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster and holds one or more containers.
- Containers within a Pod share the same network namespace and can communicate easily.

### Service

- This is like a **phone directory** for Pods.
- Since Pods can come and go, a Service provides a stable **"address"** so that other parts of your application can find them.

- Abstracts the functionality of a set of Pods as a network service.
- Enables discovery and communication between different parts of an application.
- Can be exposed internally within the cluster or externally to the internet.

### Volume

- This is like an **external hard-drive** that can be attached to a Pod to store data.
- Provides a way to store and share data between containers within a Pod.
- Survives the container's lifecycle, preserving data even if the container restarts.
- Various types of volumes cater to different storage needs.
  - **PersistentVolume (PV)**: represents a piece of storage in the cluster.
  - **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**: is a request for storage by a user.
  - Together, they provide a way to use **networked storage** resources in a Pod.

### Namespace

- Think of it as having different folders on a shared computer, where each team can only see their own folder.
- Virtually partitions a Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters.
- It Helps in organizing and isolating resources within a cluster.
- Useful for multi-tenancy, team collaboration, and resource management.

### Ingress

- Think of this as the **front door** for external access to your applications.
- Manages external access to services within a cluster.
- controlling how HTTP and HTTPS traffic should be routed to your services.
- Acts as a traffic manager, allowing external users to access services based on rules.
- Offers more control over routing and can handle SSL termination.

### Helm

- A **package manager** for Kubernetes applications.
- Simplifies the deployment and management of applications by defining, installing, and upgrading even the most complex Kubernetes applications.

### HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA)

- Automatically adjusts the number of Pods in a deployment or replica set based on observed CPU utilization or other custom metrics.
- Ensures that applications have the resources they need to run efficiently.
