# Kubernetes Object

- When we talk about **Kubernetes objects**, we're referring to configurations that you write in a **manifest file**.
- It is like a digital blueprint that tells Kubernetes how to manage and run your applications.
- It is written in YAML or JSON format and contains the specifications for the **desired state** of your application or workload.

## Key Characteristics of Kubernetes Objects:

### Declarative Configuration:

- When you write the manifest file, means you are **declaring the desired state** rather than giving steps to achieve it.

### Desired State Specification:

- You describe how you want your apps to run **(desired state)**.

### Immutable:

- means, Once you are up and running, you don't directly change them. Instead, you create new version of existing ones.
- It's like updating your profile picture—instead of changing the old one, you upload a new and improved version.

### Self-Healing:

- Kubernetes continuously monitors the cluster and insures that the **current state** matches the **desired state**.

## Common Examples of Kubernetes Objects:

1. **Pod:**

   - Fundamental deployable unit in Kubernetes, typically containing a single container.

2. **Deployment:**

   - Orchestrates deployment, scaling, and updates of pods, supporting rolling updates.

3. **Service:**

   - Defines a pod set, providing stable IP and DNS for seamless communication.

4. **Namespace:**

   - Segregates cluster resources, mitigating naming conflicts among users or teams.

5. **ConfigMap:**

   - Separates configuration artifacts, enabling flexible management.

6. **Secret:**

   - Securely stores confidential information separately from application code.

7. **PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):**

   - PV represents physical storage, while PVC fulfills a user's storage request.

8. **ServiceAccount:**

   - Establishes an identity for pod processes, controlling access to cluster resources.

9. **Ingress:**

   - Manages external access to services, facilitating HTTP and HTTPS route definitions.

10. **Job:**

    - Executes tasks to completion, suitable for batch processing or unique tasks.

11. **DaemonSet:**

    - Guarantees a pod copy on specified nodes, often used for cluster-level services.

12. **StatefulSet:**

    - Manages stateful applications with stable network identities and persistent storage.

13. **ReplicaSet:**

    - Ensures a specified number of replica pods run continuously.

14. **HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA):**

    - Dynamically adjusts pod count based on CPU or custom metrics.

15. **ConfigMap and Secret (Reiteration):**

    - Decouples configuration and stores sensitive information separately.

16. **CronJob:**

    - Schedules regular jobs, similar to cron jobs in Unix-like systems.

17. **NetworkPolicy:**

    - Defines communication rules between pods and network endpoints.

18. **ResourceQuota:**

    - Sets constraints on pod resource usage to prevent depletion.

19. **PodDisruptionBudget:**

    - Ensures a minimum number of pods remain available during planned disruptions.

20. **Endpoints:**

    - Connects services and pods, providing a stable network identity.

21. **Role and RoleBinding:**

    - **Role:** Defines permissions within a namespace.
    - **RoleBinding:** Assigns roles to users, groups, or service accounts.

22. **ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding:**

    - **ClusterRole:** Establishes cluster-wide permissions.
    - **ClusterRoleBinding:** Associates cluster roles with users, groups, or service accounts.

23. **PodSecurityPolicy:**

    - Defines conditions for pod acceptance, enhancing cluster security.

24. **StorageClass:**

    - Defines storage classes for dynamic provisioning of persistent storage.

25. **Volume:**

    - Represents a directory with data or a storage device in a pod.

26. **EndpointSlices:**

    - Divides service endpoints into smaller slices for improved service discovery.

27. **Event:**
    - Represents occurrences in the cluster, providing information about changes.
