# Introduction to Jobs

**Official k8s Docs:** https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/

## What are Kubernetes Jobs?

- Kubernetes Jobs is a resource used to run tasks or processes in your Kubernetes cluster that are meant to be done just once.
- They ensure that a certain task gets completed successfully and then stops.
- These jobs can be anything from running a script, processing data, or performing a specific action.
- Once the job is finished, Kubernetes takes care of cleaning up after itself.

### Running an example Job

Here is an example Job config. It computes Ï€ to 2000 places and prints it out. It takes around 10s to complete.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: pi
          image: perl:5.34.0
          command: ["perl", "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

## Key Features of Jobs:

1.  **One-Time Execution**: Jobs are designed for one-time execution, meaning they run until successful completion and then terminate.
2.  **Completion Guarantees**: Kubernetes ensures that a Job successfully terminates. It will restart the Job's pod if it fails or if a pod is terminated prematurely due to node failure.
3.  **Parallelism**: Jobs can be configured to run multiple pod instances concurrently to process workloads in parallel.
4.  **Backoff Policy**: Jobs can be configured with a backoff policy to control how long Kubernetes waits before restarting a failed pod.
5.  **Pod Termination**: Pods created by a Job are automatically terminated once their workload is completed successfully.

## Anatomy of a Job:

- **Spec**: Defines the desired state of the Job, including the pod template specification, completion criteria, and other parameters.
- **Status**: Reflects the current state of the Job, including information about the number of successfully completed pods, failed pods, and the overall completion status.

## Best Practices:

1.  **Resource Management**: Ensure that you allocate appropriate CPU and memory resources for your Job pods based on their workload requirements.
2.  **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to track the progress and status of your Job executions.
3.  **Idempotency**: Ensure that your Jobs are idempotent, meaning they produce the same result regardless of how many times they are executed. This helps in handling retries and failures gracefully.
4.  **Cleanup**: Set up mechanisms to clean up completed or failed Jobs and their associated resources to avoid cluttering your cluster.
