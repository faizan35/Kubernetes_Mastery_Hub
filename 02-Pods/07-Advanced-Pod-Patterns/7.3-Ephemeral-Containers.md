# **7.3 Ephemeral Containers**

**Ephemeral Containers** are a special type of container in Kubernetes designed primarily for debugging purposes. Unlike regular containers, they are not part of the original Pod specification and can be added to a running Pod temporarily to inspect and troubleshoot issues. Ephemeral Containers do not modify the Pod’s persistent state and are removed after they exit.

#### **1. Debugging with Ephemeral Containers**

**Purpose of Ephemeral Containers**:

- **Debugging**: Ephemeral Containers allow developers to troubleshoot a running application without disrupting the main containers. They are particularly useful for inspecting the state of an application, running diagnostic commands, or examining logs when the main application container is in a bad state or has limited diagnostic tools.
- **Non-Persistent**: These containers are temporary and do not persist beyond their intended debugging session. Once they complete their task, they are removed from the Pod.
- **Safe Troubleshooting**: Since they are non-disruptive, using Ephemeral Containers does not affect the running application, making them ideal for in-production debugging.

**Example Use Cases**:

- **Inspecting Application State**: You can use an Ephemeral Container to run shell commands inside the Pod's environment to inspect logs, configuration files, or network connections.
- **Running Diagnostic Tools**: If the main application container lacks debugging tools (e.g., `curl`, `tcpdump`), an Ephemeral Container can be used to install and run these tools.
- **Attaching Debuggers**: Developers can attach debuggers to a running application container by using an Ephemeral Container.

#### **2. Use Cases and Configuration**

**Configuring Ephemeral Containers**:

- Ephemeral Containers are defined and added to an existing Pod using the `kubectl debug` command. They are not included in the original Pod specification.

**Example of Adding an Ephemeral Container**:

```bash
kubectl debug my-pod --image=busybox --target=my-app
```

In this example:

- The `kubectl debug` command is used to add an Ephemeral Container to the running Pod `my-pod`.
- The `--image=busybox` flag specifies the image for the Ephemeral Container.
- The `--target=my-app` flag targets the specific container in the Pod (`my-app`) to share the process namespace for debugging.

**Example YAML Configuration**:
While you cannot directly configure Ephemeral Containers in a Pod spec (as they are added dynamically), here's an illustration of what the YAML might look like after adding an Ephemeral Container:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-app
      image: my-app-image
  ephemeralContainers:
    - name: debug-container
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 3600"]
```

**Key Points**:

- **Temporary Nature**: Ephemeral Containers do not persist beyond their debugging session. They are automatically removed once they exit.
- **No Side Effects**: They do not alter the Pod's original container set or affect the Pod's restart policy.
- **Diagnostics Only**: Use Ephemeral Containers only for diagnostics and debugging; they are not intended for running production workloads or making permanent changes to the application.

**Best Practices**:

- **Minimal Impact**: Keep Ephemeral Containers lightweight and focused on the task to minimize resource usage.
- **Secure Debugging**: Ensure that only authorized personnel can add Ephemeral Containers, as they provide direct access to the Pod’s environment.
