# **8.1 Purpose of Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)**

### **Pod Disruption Budgets: Keeping Your Application Running Smoothly**

A **Pod Disruption Budget (PDB)** is like a safety net for your application. It tells Kubernetes, "I need to keep a certain number of Pods running, even when you're doing maintenance or updates." This ensures that your application remains available and doesn’t suffer from unexpected downtime.

### **Why Use a Pod Disruption Budget?**

Imagine you’re running a web application with multiple instances (Pods) spread across your cluster. During a node update or scaling operation, you wouldn’t want all your instances to be taken down at once, right? That’s where a **PDB** comes in. It helps you define the minimum number of Pods that should stay up and running, even during disruptions.

### **How It Works:**

A PDB lets you specify:

- **Minimum Available Pods**: The least number of Pods that should always be available.
- **Max Unavailable Pods**: The maximum number of Pods that can be taken down at any time.

#### **Example**:

Let’s say you have an application running with 5 Pods, and you set a PDB that allows only 1 Pod to be unavailable at a time. This means during maintenance or scaling, Kubernetes will make sure that at least 4 Pods are always running, keeping your application stable.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-app-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```

### **Why Should a DevOps Engineer Care?**

As a DevOps engineer, **PDBs** are crucial for maintaining your application's uptime. By setting up PDBs, you ensure that your critical services stay online even when the cluster undergoes disruptions, like node upgrades or scaling operations. It’s all about ensuring your users don’t experience downtime, keeping everything running smoothly, even during changes.

In summary, **Pod Disruption Budgets** give you control over how many Pods can go down at any time, helping you manage your application’s availability during planned or unplanned disruptions.

## **1. Ensuring Minimum Pod Availability During Disruptions**

- **Definition**: A PDB defines a budget for how many Pods of a replicated application (like a Deployment, StatefulSet, or ReplicaSet) can be taken down simultaneously. It ensures that a minimum number of Pods remain operational to maintain service availability.
- **Voluntary Disruptions**: These include actions such as node draining, manual scaling of resources, or Kubernetes cluster upgrades. PDBs protect the application from becoming completely unavailable during such operations by limiting the number of Pods that can be disrupted at any one time.

- **Involuntary Disruptions**: PDBs do not protect against involuntary disruptions like hardware failures, but they are designed to handle situations where the disruption is planned and managed.

**Example Scenario**:

- You have a Deployment running 10 Pods. If you set a PDB that requires at least 8 Pods to be available, the system will ensure that only 2 Pods can be voluntarily disrupted at the same time. This way, 8 Pods will always remain available to handle traffic.

## **2. Preventing Full Application Downtime**

- **Continuous Service Availability**: The primary goal of a PDB is to prevent scenarios where the entire application becomes unavailable due to multiple Pods being taken down simultaneously. This is especially critical for services that must maintain uptime even during cluster maintenance.

- **Graceful Handling of Disruptions**: By carefully managing disruptions through PDBs, Kubernetes allows for gradual, controlled scaling down or rolling updates of Pods without causing a complete outage.

**Summary**:
PDBs play a crucial role in maintaining the availability and reliability of applications during planned disruptions. By specifying the minimum number of Pods that must remain available, PDBs prevent full application downtime and ensure that services continue to operate smoothly during cluster maintenance, updates, or scaling activities.
