### **5.1 Monitoring Pod Health**

Monitoring the health of Pods in Kubernetes is crucial to ensure that your applications are running as expected. Kubernetes provides built-in mechanisms like **Readiness Probes** and **Liveness Probes** to automate health checks and take corrective actions if necessary.

#### **1. Readiness Probes**

**Readiness Probes** are used to determine whether a container within a Pod is ready to start serving traffic. If the readiness check fails, the Pod will not be added to the list of available endpoints for a Service, which means it will not receive traffic.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Ensuring that a container has finished its startup routine before accepting traffic.
  - Delaying traffic to containers that depend on other services or configurations.

**Types of Readiness Probes**:

- **HTTP GET Probe**: Kubernetes sends an HTTP GET request to the container and expects a successful response (2xx status code) to mark the Pod as ready.
- **TCP Socket Probe**: Kubernetes attempts to open a TCP connection to the container. If successful, the Pod is considered ready.
- **Exec Probe**: Kubernetes runs a specified command inside the container. If the command exits with a status code of 0, the Pod is marked as ready.

**Example of a Readiness Probe**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /health
          port: 80
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 10
```

In this example:

- Kubernetes sends an HTTP GET request to `/health` on port `80` after an initial delay of 5 seconds, every 10 seconds. If the response is successful, the Pod is marked as ready.

#### **2. Liveness Probes**

**Liveness Probes** are used to determine whether a container is still running. If the liveness check fails, Kubernetes will restart the container to try to recover from the failure.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Detecting and recovering from application crashes or deadlocks.
  - Restarting containers that become unresponsive or fail to function correctly.

**Types of Liveness Probes**:

- **HTTP GET Probe**: Similar to the readiness probe but used to check if the container is alive.
- **TCP Socket Probe**: Kubernetes checks if a TCP connection can be established to the container.
- **Exec Probe**: Kubernetes runs a command inside the container, and if it exits with a non-zero status, the container is restarted.

**Example of a Liveness Probe**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /health
          port: 80
        initialDelaySeconds: 15
        periodSeconds: 20
```

In this example:

- Kubernetes sends an HTTP GET request to `/health` on port `80` after an initial delay of 15 seconds, every 20 seconds. If the response fails, the container is restarted.

#### **3. Pod Health Checks**

Kubernetes uses these probes to manage the lifecycle of Pods:

- **Restarting Containers**: If a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.
- **Traffic Management**: If a readiness probe fails, Kubernetes stops sending traffic to the Pod but does not restart it.
- **Rolling Updates**: Readiness probes are often used during rolling updates to ensure that new Pods are ready to serve traffic before the old ones are terminated.

#### **Best Practices**

- **Use Readiness Probes for Dependencies**: Use readiness probes to ensure that your application does not receive traffic until it is fully ready.
- **Configure Liveness Probes with Care**: Set liveness probes to detect actual failures and avoid false positives that could lead to unnecessary restarts.
- **Monitor Probe Failures**: Regularly monitor the status of your probes to detect patterns that might indicate application issues.

# Health Checks with Probes

Kubernetes uses **probes** to assess the health of your application's containers and pods.

#### What are Probes?

- Mechanism used to **check and monitor** the **health** of containers running within pods.

**<u>There are three types of probes</u> :-**

1. Readiness probes,
2. Liveness probes, and
3. Startup probes.

---

## 1. Readiness Probes:

Purpose
: It tells pod is ready or not to start accepting traffic.

Scenario
: Useful during **rolling updates**.

How it Works
: It sends a request to a specified endpoint (path and port) within the container. If the container responds successfully, the pod is considered ready.

- Example in a Deployment YAML:

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 80
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
```

## Liveness Probes:

Purpose
: Checks whether a container is still running and healthy.

Scenario
: Helps restart containers that are stuck in an unrecoverable state.

How it Works
: It similarly sends a request to a specified endpoint. If the container fails to respond successfully within a specified time frame or after a certain number of consecutive failures, Kubernetes considers the container unhealthy and may restart it.

- Example in a Deployment YAML:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 80
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
```

## Startup Probes:

Purpose
: Delays the startup of containers until a specified condition is met.

Scenario
: Ensures that a container is fully initialized before it starts receiving traffic.

How it Works
: The startup probe is initiated when a pod starts. It performs checks similar to readiness probes but is specifically designed to determine **when a container is fully initialized** and ready to receive traffic.

- Example in a Deployment YAML:

```yaml
startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 80
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

In these examples:

- **`httpGet`**: specifies an HTTP request to the `/healthz` endpoint on port `80`.
- **`initialDelaySeconds`**: sets a delay before the first probe is executed.
- **`periodSeconds`**: defines the interval between subsequent probes.
- **`failureThreshold`**: (for **startup probes**) determines the number of consecutive failures required for the probe to be considered failed.
