# 1.3 Creating and Managing Pods

## Basic `kubectl` Commands to Create, View, and Manage Pods

### Creating a Pod:

- The most straightforward way to create a Pod is using a YAML configuration file, but you can also create a simple Pod using `kubectl` directly.

#### Example:

##### Using `kubectl run` command:

```bash
kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx
```

This command creates a Pod named `my-pod` with a single container running the `nginx` image.

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

- Use this for dry run and viewing.

###### Used for:

- Primarily used for creating single Pods for testing scenarios.
- Not to create Deployments, Jobs, and other resources.

##### Using `kubectl create` command:

- Can't be created with this command.

### Viewing Pods:

- You can view the list of all Pods running in the cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```
- To get detailed information about a specific Pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```
- For real-time updates on the status of Pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --watch
  ```

### Deleting a Pod:

- To delete a specific Pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
  ```

### **YAML Configuration for Pods**

- **Defining a Pod in YAML**: The YAML configuration file defines the desired state for a Pod, including its name, containers, image, ports, and other specifications.

  Example of a simple Pod configuration:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: my-pod
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80
  ```

#### **Applying the Configuration**:

- After defining the Pod in a YAML file (e.g., `pod.yaml`), you can create it using:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
  ```
- This command tells Kubernetes to create the Pod according to the specifications in the file.

#### **Editing and Updating Pods**:

- To edit the configuration of an existing Pod:

  ```bash
  kubectl edit pod <pod-name>
  ```

- Since Pods are **immutable** (cannot be changed directly), Kubernetes doesn't actually modify the existing Pod. Instead, it creates a new Pod with the updated specification.

### **Labels, Selectors, and Annotations**

- **Labels**: Key-value pairs attached to Pods that can be used to organize and select groups of Pods. Labels are used by Kubernetes to identify and group Pods.

  - Example:
    ```yaml
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        env: production
    ```

- **Selectors**: Used to query and filter Pods based on their labels. Selectors are essential for services, replication controllers, and deployments.

  - Example:
    ```yaml
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: my-app
        env: production
    ```

- **Annotations**: Key-value pairs similar to labels, but they are not used to select Pods. Instead, they store arbitrary metadata and are often used by other tools and systems for various purposes.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    metadata:
      annotations:
        description: "This Pod runs the NGINX web server."
    ```

#### **Demo YAML Configuration**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    app: webserver
    environment: production
  annotations:
    description: "This pod runs the Nginx web server in the production environment."
    owner: "team-web"
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: webserver
    environment: production
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

### **Explanation**

#### **1. Labels**

- **Location**: Under `metadata:`, you can see the `labels:` section.
- **Purpose**: Labels are key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects like Pods, Services, or Deployments.
  - **Example**:
    - `app: webserver`: This label indicates that the Pod is part of the "webserver" application.
    - `environment: production`: This label specifies that the Pod is running in the "production" environment.
- **Use Case**: Labels are used to group and select objects in Kubernetes. They help in organizing and managing your resources.

#### **2. Selectors**

- **Location**: Under the `spec:` section of the Service definition, you can see the `selector:` field.
- **Purpose**: Selectors are used by Kubernetes to identify a set of Pods that a Service should apply to.
  - **Example**:
    - The selector matches the Pods that have the labels `app: webserver` and `environment: production`.
- **Use Case**: In this example, the Service will route traffic to any Pod that matches these labels, ensuring that only the relevant Pods receive traffic.

#### **3. Annotations**

- **Location**: Also under `metadata:`, you can see the `annotations:` section.
- **Purpose**: Annotations are also key-value pairs, but they store metadata that is not used to identify or select objects.
  - **Example**:
    - `description`: Provides a human-readable description of what the Pod does.
    - `owner`: Indicates who is responsible for this Pod.
- **Use Case**: Annotations are useful for attaching non-identifying information to objects, such as documentation, ownership, or configuration data.

### **Summary**

- **Labels**: Used to identify and group Kubernetes objects.
- **Selectors**: Used to select Pods based on their labels for services or other operations.
- **Annotations**: Used to attach metadata to objects without affecting how they are identified or selected.
