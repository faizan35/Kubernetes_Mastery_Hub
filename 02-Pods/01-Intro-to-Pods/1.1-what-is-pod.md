# **1.1 What is a Pod?**

- It is the smallest and simplest unit in Kubernetes.
- Pod is a basic building block in Kubernetes that can hold one or more containers.

##### What is a containers?

It is like a virtual box that runs the application inside it.

## **Purpose of Pods or Why to run the container inside the pod**

- Pod ensures that your containerized application has everything it needs, like necessary environment, network settings and storage, to run properly.

- Bacically what pod manages the containers.

## **Difference Between Pods and Containers**

- **Containers**: Its is basically like a box that runs the application inside the box is called Containers.

- **Pods**: Its is smallest unit of k8s that manages the containers, containers runs inside the pods.

## **Single vs. Multi-container Pods**

#### **Single-container Pods**:

The most common type, where a Pod contains only one container. This container is typically the main application, and the Podâ€™s lifecycle is tied directly to this single container.

#### **Multi-container Pods**:

We use multi-container pods to run containers that need to work closely together. For example:

1. **Supporting Roles**: One container might handle the main application, while another logs data or manages proxy services.
2. **Shared Resources**: Containers in the same pod can easily share storage and network, allowing them to communicate and function as a single, cohesive unit.
