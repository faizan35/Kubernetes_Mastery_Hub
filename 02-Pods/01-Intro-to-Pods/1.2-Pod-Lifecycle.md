# **1.2 Pod Lifecycle**

The lifecycle is managed through various phases, states, and status fields that provide insights into the current condition and progress of the Pod.

## **Phases of a Pod**

1. **Pending**: The Pod is waiting to start.

   - **Example**: Imagine you submit a job to Kubernetes. The system is finding a place to run it (assigning to a node) and downloading the necessary files (container images).

2. **Running**: The Pod is actively running.

   - **Example**: Your web application is now live and handling requests. The containers inside the Pod are up and running.

3. **Succeeded**: The Pod has completed its work successfully.

   - **Example**: You ran a batch job to process data, and it finished without errors. The job is done, so the Pod won’t restart.

4. **Failed**: The Pod tried to run but didn’t succeed.

   - **Example**: Your database migration script failed because of an error, so the Pod won’t try to run again.

5. **Unknown**: The system can’t tell what’s happening with the Pod.
   - **Example**: The node where your Pod was running crashed, and Kubernetes can’t communicate with it, so the Pod's state is unclear.

## **Pod Termination and Cleanup**

### 1. **Termination Process**:

- Kubernetes sends a **graceful shutdown signal (SIGTERM)** to the containers when a Pod is deleted.
- The containers have a set amount of time (defined by `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`) to shut down gracefully.
- After the grace period, if the containers haven’t shut down, Kubernetes forcefully stops them with a **SIGKILL** signal.

### 2. **Pod Cleanup**:

- Kubernetes automatically cleans up resources like memory and CPU once the Pod is terminated.
- If the Pod failed, it might leave behind logs or other data for debugging before being fully removed.

## **Pod States and Status Fields**

- **Pod Conditions**: Pods have a set of conditions that describe the current state of the Pod from the node's perspective. Examples include:

  - `PodScheduled`: Indicates whether the Pod has been assigned to a node.
  - `Initialized`: Indicates whether all init containers in the Pod have started successfully.
  - `ContainersReady`: Indicates whether all containers in the Pod are ready to serve requests.
  - `Ready`: Indicates whether the Pod is ready to serve requests and is considered available.

- **Status Fields**:
  - `phase`: The high-level summary of the Pod’s lifecycle phase (e.g., Running, Pending).
  - `conditions`: More detailed information about the Pod’s state (as mentioned above).
  - `hostIP` and `podIP`: The IP addresses of the node where the Pod is running and the Pod itself.
  - `startTime`: The time at which the Pod was acknowledged by the Kubernetes system.
