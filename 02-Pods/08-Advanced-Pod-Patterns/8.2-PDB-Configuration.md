### **8.2 PDB Configuration**

Configuring a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) in Kubernetes involves defining the rules that control how many Pods can be disrupted simultaneously. This is done using either the `minAvailable` or `maxUnavailable` settings, which specify the minimum number of Pods that must remain available or the maximum number of Pods that can be disrupted, respectively. Additionally, labels can be used to apply PDBs to specific sets of Pods.

#### **1. Setting `minAvailable` or `maxUnavailable` Pods**

- **`minAvailable`**:

  - This setting defines the minimum number of Pods that must be available at all times during a disruption.
  - **Example**: If you have a Deployment with 5 Pods and set `minAvailable` to 3, at least 3 Pods must be running at any given time. This ensures that only up to 2 Pods can be disrupted at once.

- **`maxUnavailable`**:

  - This setting specifies the maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during a disruption.
  - **Example**: If your Deployment has 10 Pods and `maxUnavailable` is set to 2, only 2 Pods can be disrupted at any given time, ensuring that at least 8 Pods are always available.

- **Choosing Between `minAvailable` and `maxUnavailable`**:
  - The choice between `minAvailable` and `maxUnavailable` depends on the specific requirements of your application. If you have strict requirements on how many Pods must always be running, use `minAvailable`. If you want to limit how many Pods can be down at once, use `maxUnavailable`.

**Example YAML Configuration**:
Here’s an example of how to define a PDB using both `minAvailable` and `maxUnavailable`.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-app-pdb
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  minAvailable: 3
  # or
  maxUnavailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```

In this example:

- **`minAvailable: 3`** ensures that at least 3 Pods must be available during any disruption.
- **`selector`** is used to target Pods labeled with `app: my-app` in the `my-namespace` namespace.

#### **2. Using Labels to Apply PDBs to Specific Pods**

- **Labels**:

  - Labels are key-value pairs that are attached to Kubernetes objects, such as Pods. They are used to identify and organize resources.
  - PDBs use labels to select the group of Pods they apply to. This allows for fine-grained control over which Pods are governed by a particular PDB.

- **Selectors**:
  - The `selector` field in a PDB definition is used to specify which Pods the PDB should apply to. The selector matches the labels on the Pods.

**Example of Applying PDB to Specific Pods**:
Suppose you have a set of Pods with the label `tier=frontend`. You can create a PDB that applies only to these Pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: frontend-pdb
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  minAvailable: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
```

In this configuration:

- The PDB named `frontend-pdb` applies to all Pods with the label `tier=frontend` in the `my-namespace` namespace.
- It ensures that at least 5 of these Pods remain available during any voluntary disruption.

**Key Points to Remember**:

- **Namespace-Specific**: PDBs are namespace-scoped, meaning they only apply to Pods within the same namespace.
- **Impact on Cluster Operations**: If a PDB cannot be satisfied (e.g., if it’s impossible to maintain the required number of available Pods), voluntary disruptions like node draining will be blocked or delayed until the PDB can be respected.
- **Balancing Availability and Flexibility**: PDBs help balance the need for high availability with the operational flexibility of performing cluster maintenance. They ensure that service disruptions are controlled and minimized.

**Summary**:
Configuring a PDB involves setting either `minAvailable` or `maxUnavailable` to control Pod availability during disruptions and using labels to target specific Pods. This configuration ensures that your application remains resilient during voluntary disruptions, such as node maintenance or updates.
