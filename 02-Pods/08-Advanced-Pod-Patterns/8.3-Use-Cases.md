### **8.3 Use Cases for Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)**

Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) are crucial in maintaining application availability during planned disruptions, such as node maintenance, upgrades, or scaling activities. Below are some common use cases where PDBs are particularly beneficial:

#### **1. Maintaining Service Uptime During Node Maintenance or Updates**

- **Scenario**: In Kubernetes, nodes may need to be drained for maintenance, such as applying security patches, upgrading the operating system, or performing hardware maintenance. During node draining, all Pods running on the node are evicted and rescheduled on other nodes.
- **PDB Role**: A PDB ensures that only a specified number of Pods are evicted at a time, preventing a situation where too many Pods are disrupted simultaneously. This helps maintain the availability of the service even during node maintenance.

- **Example**: If you have a StatefulSet with 10 Pods and you set a PDB that requires a minimum of 8 Pods to be available, Kubernetes will ensure that at least 8 Pods are running at all times during the node maintenance. This avoids a complete service disruption.

#### **2. Balancing Pod Availability and Cluster Operations**

- **Scenario**: Cluster operations such as scaling down a Deployment, updating Kubernetes itself, or upgrading applications require careful handling of running Pods to ensure continued service availability.

- **PDB Role**: PDBs provide a balance between the need to perform cluster operations and the requirement to keep the application up and running. They prevent too many Pods from being disrupted at once, ensuring that a minimum number of Pods are always available to serve requests.

- **Example**: During a rolling update, a PDB can be configured to allow only a certain number of Pods to be updated at once, ensuring that the service remains available while the update is in progress.

#### **3. Handling Stateful Applications**

- **Scenario**: Stateful applications, such as databases or applications with persistent storage, require careful management during disruptions to avoid data loss or service unavailability.

- **PDB Role**: For StatefulSets, PDBs can be critical in ensuring that the application remains available while Pods are being rescheduled or during maintenance. They ensure that the application maintains the required number of running instances, avoiding data inconsistencies or downtime.

- **Example**: A database application running as a StatefulSet might have a PDB that ensures a minimum of 2 out of 3 replicas are always running, allowing for safe maintenance operations without compromising the availability of the database.

#### **4. Cluster Autoscaling**

- **Scenario**: When using cluster autoscaling, nodes might be added or removed based on resource demands. This can result in the eviction of Pods from nodes that are being scaled down.

- **PDB Role**: PDBs ensure that autoscaling operations do not unintentionally disrupt critical services by evicting too many Pods at once. By enforcing minimum availability, PDBs help maintain the reliability of applications during scaling events.

- **Example**: If a cluster autoscaler decides to scale down nodes due to low resource usage, a PDB ensures that the scaling down process does not reduce the number of available Pods below a critical threshold, thus maintaining service availability.

#### **5. Deployments with High Availability Requirements**

- **Scenario**: Certain applications have strict availability requirements, where downtime is not acceptable, such as critical financial services, healthcare applications, or online retail platforms.

- **PDB Role**: PDBs are used to enforce strict availability policies, ensuring that even during disruptions, a minimum number of instances of the application remain operational, thus preventing service outages.

- **Example**: For an online payment service, a PDB might require that at least 95% of the Pods remain available during any disruption, ensuring the service remains responsive and available to users at all times.

**Summary**:
PDBs are essential for maintaining application availability during planned disruptions, node maintenance, updates, and cluster autoscaling. By specifying how many Pods must remain available, PDBs prevent full service outages and ensure that critical services remain operational even during cluster operations.
