# **3.2 Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**

## **1. The Practical Story of PV and PVC**

Imagine you're a DevOps engineer at a company that runs a large web application. Your application needs to store user data—like photos or settings—somewhere permanent, even if the application restarts or moves to a different server. This is where **Persistent Volumes (PV)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)** come into play.

#### **Persistent Volume (PV): The Storage Provider**

Think of a Persistent Volume (PV) as a storage unit in a data center. It’s like a storage resource that you set up beforehand. You, as the DevOps engineer, define this storage, saying, "Here’s a space where data can be stored."

For example, you might have a PV that's a 100GB disk on a cloud service like AWS or Google Cloud. This PV is just sitting there, waiting for someone to use it.

#### **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC): The Storage Request**

Now, let’s say your application (or Pod) needs to store some data. But your Pod doesn’t know where or how much space is available—it just knows it needs storage. This is where the **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** comes in. A PVC is like a request that says, "I need 10GB of storage for my data, and I need it to be read/write accessible."

The PVC goes out and finds a PV that meets its requirements. If there’s a matching PV available (say, your 100GB disk that you set up earlier), Kubernetes links them together. Now, the application can store its data on that 10GB portion of the PV.

**Here’s what Kubernetes does:**

- When a PVC is created, Kubernetes searches for a suitable PV.
- If a match is found, the PVC is “bound” to that PV, and your application can start using the storage.

### **Example**

Let’s say your application needs storage for user uploads. You might set up a PV like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 100Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

Then, your application might request storage with a PVC:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

Kubernetes sees the PVC, matches it with the PV, and your application gets the storage it needs.

## **Persistent Volumes (PVs)**

A Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator. It's an abstraction of the underlying storage resource, which could be a disk, a network file system, or any other storage backend.

#### **Purpose**:

PVs provide a way for administrators to manage storage independently of the pods. This abstraction allows the storage to persist even when the pods accessing it are deleted.

#### **Lifecycle of a Persistent Volume (PV):**

##### **Provisioning**:

A PV can be statically provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned by Kubernetes using a StorageClass.

- _Static Provisioning_: The administrator manually creates a PV, specifying the storage backend and its parameters.
- _Dynamic Provisioning_: Kubernetes automatically creates a PV when a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) requests storage, using a predefined StorageClass.

##### **Binding**:

After a PV is provisioned, it can be claimed by a PVC. When a PVC is created, Kubernetes looks for an available PV that meets the claim's requirements (size, access mode, etc.). If a matching PV is found, it is bound to the PVC.

##### **Using the PV**:

Once a PV is bound to a PVC, the storage can be mounted and used by a pod. The pod references the PVC in its configuration, which in turn points to the bound PV.

##### **Reclaiming**:

When a PVC is deleted, the PV can be reclaimed based on its reclaim policy:

- _Retain_: The PV and its data remain after the PVC is deleted, requiring manual intervention to delete or reuse.
- _Recycle_: The PV's data is scrubbed, making it available for new claims (Note: Recycling is deprecated in favor of dynamic provisioning).
- _Delete_: The PV and its data are automatically deleted when the PVC is deleted.

#### **Types of Persistent Volumes:**

- **Storage Backends**: PVs can represent different types of storage, such as:

  - _Network File Systems_: e.g., NFS, GlusterFS
  - _Block Storage_: e.g., AWS EBS, GCE Persistent Disks
  - _Object Storage_: e.g., Ceph, AWS S3 (through Rook or other CSI drivers)
  - _Local Storage_: e.g., hostPath (for testing), local volumes (for high-performance storage)

#### **Access Modes**:

PVs support different access modes, determining how the volume can be mounted by one or more pods:

- _ReadWriteOnce (RWO)_: The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
- _ReadOnlyMany (ROX)_: The volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
- _ReadWriteMany (RWX)_: The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.

#### Example of a PV definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  nfs:
    path: /mnt/data
    server: 192.168.1.100
```

## **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**

- **What is a Persistent Volume Claim?**

  - A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. A PVC specifies the size and access modes required for the storage. Kubernetes will find a PV that meets the requirements of the PVC and bind the two together.

- **PVC Lifecycle**:

  - **Binding**: When a PVC is created, Kubernetes looks for an available PV that meets the requested criteria (capacity, access mode). If a match is found, the PVC is bound to that PV.
  - **Using the PVC**: Once a PVC is bound to a PV, it can be used in a Pod by referencing the PVC in the Pod’s volume definition.
  - **Reclaiming**: After the PVC is deleted, the reclaim policy of the PV determines whether the PV will be retained, recycled, or deleted.

  Example of a PVC definition:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: my-pvc
  spec:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 5Gi
  ```

  In this example:

  - The PVC requests 5Gi of storage with `ReadWriteOnce` access mode.

- **Binding PVs to PVCs**:

  - The binding process is automatic in Kubernetes. When a PVC is created, the Kubernetes control plane searches for a PV that satisfies the PVC's requirements. If a suitable PV is found, it is bound to the PVC.
  - If no PV is available that meets the PVC's requirements, the PVC will remain unbound until a suitable PV becomes available.

  Example of a Pod using a PVC:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: my-pod
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: nginx
        volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
            name: my-storage
    volumes:
      - name: my-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: my-pvc
  ```

  In this example:

  - The Pod is using the PVC named `my-pvc`, which is bound to a PV.

## **Dynamic Provisioning of Storage**

Imagine you're a DevOps engineer and you’re managing a large Kubernetes cluster on the cloud. Your application needs storage, but you don't want to manually create and manage all the storage volumes yourself. This is where **Dynamic Provisioning** comes in handy.

#### **What is Dynamic Provisioning?**

Dynamic provisioning lets Kubernetes automatically create storage (Persistent Volumes) on-the-fly when your application requests it. It’s like having a storage assistant who knows exactly what you need and gets it for you when you ask.

#### **StorageClass: The Storage Blueprint**

A **StorageClass** is like a blueprint that tells Kubernetes what **type of storage** to create automatically. It defines:

- **Provisioner**: The storage provider, like AWS EBS or Google Persistent Disk.
- **Parameters**: Details like the type of disk (e.g., fast or standard).
- **Reclaim Policy**: What to do with the storage when you’re done using it (e.g., delete it or keep it).

##### **Example of a StorageClass**:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: gp2
reclaimPolicy: Retain
```

- **What’s happening here?** This StorageClass named `fast` tells Kubernetes to use AWS EBS storage with the `gp2` type, which is a fast disk type. The reclaim policy is `Retain`, meaning the storage won’t be deleted when the PVC is released.

#### **Using a StorageClass with a PVC**

When your application needs storage, you create a PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) that specifies a StorageClass. Kubernetes then uses the blueprint in the StorageClass to automatically create the right kind of storage for you.

##### **Example of a PVC with a StorageClass**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-dynamic-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: fast
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

- **What’s happening here?** This PVC is asking for 10Gi of storage using the `fast` StorageClass. Kubernetes will automatically create a 10Gi storage volume of the `gp2` type, as specified in the StorageClass.

### **Why Use Dynamic Provisioning?**

As a DevOps engineer, dynamic provisioning saves you time and effort. Instead of manually setting up storage every time your application needs it, Kubernetes handles it automatically, ensuring your apps always have the storage they need when they need it.
