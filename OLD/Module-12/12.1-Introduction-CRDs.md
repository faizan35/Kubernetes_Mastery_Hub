# Introduction to CRDs

- CRDs allow users to extend the Kubernetes API.
- The Kubernetes API typically includes built-in resources like Pods, Services, and Deployments.
- With CRDs, users can define their own custom resources, effectively expanding the range of objects that Kubernetes can manage.

#### Analogy

- Imagine if the manager knows about certain types of tasks (resources) like making coffee or sending emails.
- With CRDs, you can teach the manager about new tasks that are specific to your office, like ordering office supplies or organizing team events.

#### Example:

- If Kubernetes knows about running applications (like websites), CRDs allow you to **teach it** about new types of applications.
- For instance, you could create a CRD to tell Kubernetes how to manage a special kind of database or messaging system that your team uses.
