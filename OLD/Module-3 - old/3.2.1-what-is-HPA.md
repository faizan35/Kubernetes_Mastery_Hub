# Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

**ReplicaSets** -> Manual Scaling
**Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)** -> Automatic Scaling

## What is Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?

It is a feature that **automatically** adjusts(scaled up or down) the number of `pod` replicas based on observed metrics (e.g., CPU, custom metrics).

**Example Scenario:**
: If your application experiences increased traffic, the HPA can automatically scale up the number of pods to handle the load and scale down during periods of lower demand.

## Why use HPA?

- Continuous Availability
- Cost Efficiency
- Ease of Management

### Combining ReplicaSets and HPA:

- **Stability and Predictability:** Use ReplicaSets for stable workloads and predictable scaling needs.

- **Dynamic Scaling:** Integrate HPA for dynamic scaling based on observed metrics, ensuring efficient resource allocation during traffic spikes.

### Points to Note:

**1. Prerequisites:**

- Make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster.

**2. Enable Metrics Server:**

- HPA relies on the Metrics Server to collect resource utilization metrics from pods. Make sure **it's installed** in your cluster.

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
  ```

**3. Deploy an Application:**

- You need an application with resource requests and limits defined in its deployment.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sample-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sample-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sample-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: sample-container
          image: your-image:tag
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "200m"
            limits:
              cpu: "500m"
```

**4. Create an HPA:**

- Now, you can create an HPA for your deployment.

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: sample-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: sample-app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        targetAverageUtilization: 50
```

**5. Apply the Configurations:**

- Apply the deployment and HPA configurations to your cluster.

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f your-deployment.yaml
  kubectl apply -f your-hpa.yaml
  ```

**6. Monitor Scaling:**

- You can watch the HPA in action by checking its status:
  ```bash
  kubectl get hpa
  ```
