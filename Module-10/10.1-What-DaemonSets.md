# DaemonSets

System Daemon
: In the context of Kubernetes, it refers to a **background process** or **service** that runs on each node in the cluster.

## What is DaemonSets.?

**It's JOB is to runs a copy of a pod on every node within a cluster.**

## How it is done.?

- You write the manifest file. Named **daemonset-demo.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: example-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: example-container
          image: example-image:latest
```

1. **Understanding the DaemonSet:**

   - This is a Kubernetes resource of type `DaemonSet`, named `example-daemonset`.
   - It specifies that it should target **nodes** with a label `app: example`.

     - labels are associated with **nodes** as well as **pods**. When we say the DaemonSet targets nodes with a specific label, it means that the DaemonSet looks for **nodes** that have been labeled with a certain key-value pair.

2. **Labeling Nodes:**

   - **Before applying the DaemonSet**, you need to label the **nodes** where you want the pods to run.
   - For example, label a node using:

     ```bash
     kubectl label nodes <node-name> app=example
     ```

   - This command adds a label `app: example` to the specified node.

3. **Apply**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f daemonset-demo.yaml
   ```

4. **DaemonSet Selection:**

   - The DaemonSet will automatically identify **nodes** with the label `app: example`.
   - It will create and manage one pod on each of these labeled nodes.

### DaemonSets Use Cases:

1.  **Infrastructure Services:**

    - Ensures **uniformity** by deploying logging and monitoring agents on **every node**.

2.  **Network Plugins:**

    - Achieves **consistent networking** by deploying plugins on **all nodes**.

3.  **Security Solutions:**

    - Applies **security measures** across the cluster with agents on **each node**.

4.  **Custom Daemon Processes:**

    - Runs application-specific daemons, maintaining presence on **every node**.

5.  **Resource Utilization:**

    - Optimizes resources by scaling horizontally and deploying on **all nodes**.
