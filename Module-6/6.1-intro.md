# ConfigMaps and Secrets

## What are ConfigMaps?

- Used for storing non-sensitive configuration data, such as environment variables, configuration files, or any key-value pairs.
- Data is in clear text and doesn't provide any encryption or security features.
- Suitable for sharing configuration across multiple pods and containers.
- Example use case: Storing application configuration files, environment variables.

## What are Secrets?

- Designed for storing sensitive information, like passwords, API keys, and certificates.
- Data is Base64 encoded for obfuscation(making something difficult to understand), <u>though it's not a form of secure encryption</u>.
- Provides a more secure way to handle confidential information within Kubernetes.
- Example use case: Managing database passwords, API keys, TLS certificates.

## ConfigMaps Use Cases:

**1. Application Configuration:**

- **Scenario:** You have a microservices-based application with multiple components requiring different configuration settings.
- **Use Case:** Create ConfigMaps for each microservice, storing configuration parameters like database connection strings, API endpoints, and feature flags.

**2\. Environment Variables:**

- **Scenario:** Your application relies on environment variables for runtime configuration.
- **Use Case:** Use ConfigMaps to define environment variables and inject them into your application pods. This ensures consistency across different environments (dev, staging, production).

**3\. Non-sensitive Data Storage:**

- **Scenario:** Storing non-sensitive data that needs to be shared across containers or pods.
- **Use Case:** ConfigMaps can hold non-sensitive data such as static files, configuration files, or any data that multiple containers within a pod need access to.

## Secrets Use Cases:

**1\. Database Credentials:**

- **Scenario:** Your application needs to connect to a database, and you want to secure the database credentials.
- **Use Case:** Store the database username, password, and connection details in a Secret. Mount the Secret as files or environment variables in the application pods securely.

**2\. API Keys:**

- **Scenario:** Your application interacts with external APIs and requires API keys.
- **Use Case:** Instead of hardcoding API keys in your application code or configuration files, use Kubernetes Secrets to manage and securely inject API keys into your pods.

**3\. SSL/TLS Certificates:**

- **Scenario:** Securing communication between services or exposing your application over HTTPS.
- **Use Case:** Store SSL/TLS certificates as Secrets. Mount these certificates into your pods, enabling secure communication without exposing sensitive information in your application code.

**4\. Configuration Files with Sensitive Data:**

- **Scenario:** Your application uses sensitive configuration files.
- **Use Case:** Store the sensitive configuration files (e.g., for authentication or authorization) in Secrets. Mount these files into your pods to ensure secure access and handling of sensitive information.
