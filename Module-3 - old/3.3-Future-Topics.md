# Future Topics realted to Scalling

Kubernetes offers a few other features related to scaling pods:

1. **Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)**: This feature adjusts the CPU and memory resources allocated to individual pods based on their usage, ensuring optimal performance.

2. **Cluster Autoscaler**: This automatically adjusts the size of your cluster by adding or removing nodes based on resource requirements. It helps in managing the overall capacity of your cluster.

3. **Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB)**: While not directly about scaling, PDBs help control the disruption caused by voluntary disruptions like scaling down or updates, ensuring a stable environment.

4. **StatefulSets**: If your application requires stable network identifiers and persistent storage, StatefulSets can help with scaling and managing stateful applications.

These components, combined with ReplicaSets and HPA, provide a comprehensive set of tools for efficiently managing the scaling aspects of your Kubernetes workloads.
